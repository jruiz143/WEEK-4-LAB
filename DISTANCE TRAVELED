#PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 4-4 THE DISTANCE A VEHICLE TRAVELS CAN BE CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS: DISTANCE = SPEED X TIME
#IF A TRAIN TRAVELS 40 MILES PER HOUR FOR 3 HRS, THE DISTANCE TRAVELED IS 120 MILES. WRITE A PROGRAM THAT ASKS 
#THE USER FOR THE SPEED OF A VEHICLE (IN MILES PER HOUR) AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS IT HAS TRAVELED.
#IT SHOULD THEN USE A LOOP TO DISPLAY THE DISTANCE THE VEHICLE HAS TRAVELED FOR EACH HOUR OF THAT TIME PERIOD.
#


#ASK FOR USER THE SPEED OF VEHICLE
speed = int(input("Please enter the speed of vehicle(mph): "))
time = int(input("Please enter the number of hours it has traveled: "))


#DISPLAY THE CHART
print("\nHour\tDistance Traveled")
print("------------------------------")

# LOOP EACH HOUR
for hour in range(1, time + 1):
      distance = speed * hour #CALC DISTANCE
      print(f"{hour}\t{distance:.2f}")
