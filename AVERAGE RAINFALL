# PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 4-5
# WRITE A PROGRAM THAT USES NESTED LOOPS TO COLLECT DATA AND CALCULATE THE AVG RAINFALL OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS
# THE PROGRAM SHOULD FIRST ASK FOR THE # OF YEARS.
#OUTER LOOP WILL ITERATE ONCE FOR EACH YEAR.THE INNER LOOP WILL ITERATE 12 TIMES, ONCE FOR EACH MONTH. EACH
#ITERATION OF THE INNER LOOP WILL ASK THE USER FOR THE INCHES OF RAINFALL FOR THAT MONTH. AFTER ALL ITERATIONS,
#THE PROGRAM SHOULD DISPLAY THE NUM OF MONTHS, THE TOTAL INCHES OF RAINFALL, AND THE AVG RAINFALL PER MONTH
#FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD

#USER INPUT
num_years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

# VARIABLES INTIALIZED
total_rainfall = 0.0
num_months = num_years * 12  # TOTAL NUMBER OVER 12 MONTHS

# Outer loop for each year
for year in range(1, num_years + 1):
    print(f"\nYear {year}:")
    # Inner loop for each month
    for month in range(1, 13):
        #ASK THE USER FOR RAINFALL
        rainfall = float(input(f"Enter the inches of rainfall for month {month}: "))
        total_rainfall += rainfall  # ACCUMULATE RAINFALL

# CALC AVG RAINFALL
average_rainfall = total_rainfall / num_months if num_months > 0 else 0

# DISPLAY
