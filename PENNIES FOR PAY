#WRITE A PROGRAM THAT CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY A PERSON WOULD EARN OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IF THEIR SALARY
# IS ONE PENNY THE FIRST DAY, 2 PENNIES THE SECOND, AND CONTINUES TO DOUBLE EACH DAY. THE PROGRAM SHOULD ASK
#THE USER FOR THE NUMBER OF DAYS. DISPLAY A TABLE SHOWING WHAT THE SALARY WAS FOR EACH DAY, THEN SHOW THE TOTAL
#PAY AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE OUTPUT SHOULD BE DISPLAYED IN A DOLLAR AMOUNT, NOT THE NUMBER OF PENNIES.

# GET USER INPUT
days = int(input("Enter the number of days: "))

# INTIIALIZE SALARY AND TOTAL PAY 
salary = 0.01  # (1 penny is 0.01 dollars)
total_pay = 0.0

# DISPLAY TABLE
print("\nDay        Salary")
print("--------------------")

# LOOP EACH DAY IN RANGE
for day in range(1, days + 1):
    # DISPLAY SALARY FOR DAY
    print(f"{day:<10} ${salary:,.2f}")
    
    # ADD SALARY FOR THE CURRENT DAY TO TOTAL PAY
    total_pay += salary
    
    # DOUBLE SALARY
    salary *= 2

# Display the total pay at the end of the period
